Battle of Saiyans: Goku v Vegeta is a 1 v 1, (Player vs CPU) 2D Martial arts fighting game inspired by the popular anime series Dragon Ball Z 
The game is completely developed in Python with the help of the Pygame Module.  The program is coded using Object-Oriented Programming Language
I created this game in 10 parts gradually from making a white block move in all directions with no gravity and black background to a perfectly running game with aesthetic background, a fierce enemy, and a lethal weapon to defeat it.
This game is a little unorthodox from the games that are generally created in pygame. I hope you try it out and enjoy my game
